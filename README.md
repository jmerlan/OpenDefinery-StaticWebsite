## Sharing Shared Parameters

In today’s building industry, the adoption of BIM has grown exponentially. The “I” in BIM, however, is only being leveraged by the most experienced and innovative project teams. Even within those teams, data within a Revit model is not standardized which makes it difficult to transfer this valuable information to and from internal and external stakeholders.

The data within a Revit model is stored in shared parameters which can be created on the fly. Unfortunately, these parameters are not easily shared between models, projects, departments, or firms. OpenDefinery seeks to close this gap by providing the industry with a single repository of the world's shared parameters in which users make pick from.

## Reduce Waste by Reusing

OpenDefinery is the first platform in which all organizations can truly share shared parameters. All users have the ability to store their own shared parameters, adopt another user's parameters, or clone existing parameters to customize them to fit a standard. 

# About OpenDefinery

OpenDefinery (previously known as OpenRFA) was born from an initiative started by a group of Building Information Modeling (BIM) professionals who have identified a gap in how we currently share Revit data throughout the industry. Without a streamlined way to manage and implement shared parameters, the industry will continue to develop vast amounts of incompatible building data.
